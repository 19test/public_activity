# PublicActivity

public_activity provides smooth acitivity tracking for your ActiveRecord models in Rails 3.
Simply put: it records what has been changed or edited and gives you the ability to present those recorded activities to users - in a similar way Github does it.


## Installation

You can install this gem as you would any other gem:
    gem install public_activity
or in your Gemfile:
    gem 'public_activity'
